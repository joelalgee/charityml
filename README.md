# CharityML Donor Prediction

Predicting the best donors for CharityML using supervised learning techniques in Python

## Summary

CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. After nearly 32,000 letters were sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity.

In this project, I applied supervised learning techniques to predict which members of the population earned above $50,000 based on census data.

This project had a series of predefined steps to follow, with the analysis for each step needing to be coded. Techniques called upon included feature transformation and scaling, AdaBoost classifier, Logistic Regression, Random Forest classifier, model tuning using a grid search, and extracting feature importances.

## Files

### finding_donors.ipynb

Contains the step-by-step analysis and discussion as an interactive Jupyter Notebook.

### finding_donors.html

Static HTML version of the above.

### census.csv

Modified census dataset consisting of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper *"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid",* by Ron Kohavi. You may find this paper [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf), with the original dataset hosted on [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).
